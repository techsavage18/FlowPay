# FlowChat

## Overview
Flow Chat is a social payment application inspired by popular platforms like Venmo, CashApp, and WeChat. It combines the concept of social networking with seamless payment capabilities on the Flow blockchain. With Flow Chat, users can message wallets, FLOWN domains, transfer Flow, transfer USDC, and transfer NFTs, all within a social experience.

## Features
- Connect your wallet to the app to get started.
- Initiate chats with any FlowNS domain or Flow wallet address.
- Exchange messages and engage in conversations.
- Transfer Flow to the person you're chatting with.
- Transfer USDC if both you and the recipient have a USDC vault set up.
- Trade Dapper Sports NFTs.

## Technology Stack
- Built with an iOS native mobile app using the FCL Swift SDK and SwiftUI.
- Integration with FlowNS, USDC, and Dapper Sport studios for various functionalities.

## User Flow
1. Connect your wallet to the app.
2. Start a chat with a FlowNS domain or Flow wallet address.
3. Engage in messaging and transfer Flow or USDC.
4. Transfer Dapper Sports NFTs.

## Future Goals
- Implement a group chat and communities feature to facilitate social connections.
- Expand support for more types of NFTs.
- Decentralize the message data store, potentially using technologies like Arweave, IPFS, or Ceramic Network.

## Challenges
- The project involved learning Swift and iOS development, which presented a learning curve.
- Limited time to become well-versed in Flow and Cadence.
- Integration with Dapper Sports projects was limited to NBA TopShot due to availability constraints.
- Messages are currently stored on Firebase, but the goal is to explore decentralized data storage options like Arweave, IPFS, or Ceramic Network.
- Some UI issues are present and will be improved over time.

## Limitations
- Certain functionalities in the app are limited due to time constraints.
- Integration with other Dapper Sports projects is pending but can be similar to NBA TopShot integration.
